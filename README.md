# ComfyUI Custom Node: ControlNet Auxiliar

This ComfyUI custom node, named ControlNet Auxiliar, is designed to provide auxiliary functionalities for image processing tasks. It is particularly useful for various image manipulation and enhancement operations. The node is integrated with functionalities for converting images between different formats and applying various image processing techniques.

## Usage

### Input Types

- **image**: The input image for processing.
- **mode**: Specifies the processing mode, including options such as scribble_hed, softedge_hed, depth_midas, openpose, and more.

### Optional Parameters

The node offers the following optional parameters for customization:

- **low_threshold**: An integer specifying the low threshold value for image processing. Default: 100, Range: 1-200.
- **high_threshold**: An integer specifying the high threshold value for image processing. Default: 100, Range: 1-200.
- **image_resolution**: An integer specifying the resolution of the processed image. Default: 512, Range: 512-1024.

### Return Types

The ControlNet Auxiliar node returns processed images.

### Functionality

The node provides the following functionality:

- **process_image**: Processes the input image according to the specified mode and parameters, producing the processed image as output.

### Python Package Requirements

- **timm==0.6.12**
- **controlnet-aux==0.0.7**
- **mediapipe**



## Example Workflow

Below is an example workflow demonstrating the usage of the ControlNet Auxiliar node:

1. **Load Input Image**: Start by loading the input image you want to process.
2. **Specify Processing Mode**: Select the desired processing mode from the available options, such as scribble_hed, softedge_hed, depth_midas, openpose, etc.
3. **Adjust Optional Parameters**: Optionally, adjust the parameters such as low_threshold, high_threshold, and image_resolution based on your requirements.
4. **Process Image**: Apply the ControlNet Auxiliar node to process the input image using the specified mode and parameters.
5. **Retrieve Processed Image**: Retrieve the processed image generated by the node.
6. **Further Processing (Optional)**: You can further process the processed image or use it for downstream tasks as needed.
